Polaris is another UNIX-like kernel written in C, which uses [Limine](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine) as its default bootloader and boot protocol.
Its goal is to be simple to build and understand, while also acting as a learning experience.

> [!WARNING]
> Polaris is under active development and is not suitable for real usage.

# :video_camera: Demo Video

Here's a demo video of Polaris running DOOM and glx-gears at the same time, while also replying to network pings.

## :package: Building

Building requires a Linux environment, Windows users may use WSL2 without issues.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install **make**.
3. Run make on the repository's root.
4. Wait for the build to finish.

## :running: Running

It is recommended to use QEMU for ease of use. An example command to run Polaris would be as follows:

```
qemu-system-x86_64 -M q35 -m 512M -cdrom [ISO path] -monitor stdio -boot d -vga std
```

Here are some additional options:

- `-smp [core number]`: Tests SMP support.
- `-cpu qemu64,+la57`: Tests level 5 paging support.
- `-accel kvm -cpu host`: Enables KVM (requires host support).

## :handshake: Contributing

We would appreciate issues and pull requests, any help is appreciated!
A detailed contribution guide will be added later into development.
